1
00:00:00,441 --> 00:00:02,841
This is the Blazing Story site, a demo

2
00:00:02,841 --> 00:00:04,961
for a UI component library made for

3
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:05,561
Blazor.

4
00:00:06,597 --> 00:00:08,677
This library includes components like

5
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:11,637
buttons, date pickers, radio buttons, and

6
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,197
dropdowns. It also has more

7
00:00:14,197 --> 00:00:15,877
complex ones like steppers.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,320
This blazing story site has a new feature

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,400
called the MCP server enabled.

10
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:28,712
And in this Blazor application project, a

11
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:31,032
reference to the MCP server is already

12
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,032
set up for GitHub Copilot in Visual

13
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:33,912
Studio Code.

14
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:37,403
I have also created custom instructions

15
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:39,483
for GitHub Copilot to tell it to use the

16
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:41,523
MCP server from BlazingStory.

17
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:45,483
Now, let's try a demonstration.

18
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:48,363
We will give a text prompt and ask GitHub

19
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:50,843
Copilot to generate a checkout page UI

20
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:51,963
for an e-commerce site.

21
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:54,961
I copy the prompt and paste it into the

22
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:57,161
GitHub Copilot chat window to run it.

23
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,047
You can see that GitHub Copilot is

24
00:01:02,047 --> 00:01:04,527
sending a request to the BlazingStory MCP

25
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:05,007
server.

26
00:01:06,027 --> 00:01:07,947
Let's wait a moment for it to finish.

27
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:17,035
It is done.

28
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:23,533
Let's run it.

29
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:36,152
Using the demo UI library, it created the

30
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:37,672
page just as instructed.

31
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:40,104
You can see that the date picker,

32
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:42,584
drop-down, and radio button components

33
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:43,544
are used properly.

34
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:46,674
The stepper component is also used and

35
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:47,634
working correctly.

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,080
Let's review the generated source code.

37
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:57,336
Even the input types for the text input

38
00:01:57,336 --> 00:01:59,056
components are chosen correctly.

39
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:04,004
Next, instead of using a text prompt,

40
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:06,004
let's try generating from an image.

41
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:09,815
Here is a rough sketch of a checkout page

42
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:10,935
made in PowerPoint.

43
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:14,363
I paste this image into the GitHub

44
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:17,083
Copilot chat window in Visual StudioCode.

45
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:26,175
Then, I type a prompt asking it to

46
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:28,055
generate a page based on the attached

47
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:29,175
image, and run it.

48
00:02:31,627 --> 00:02:34,507
The generation starts. You can see

49
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:36,427
that GitHub Copilot is working while

50
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:38,987
sending requests to the BlazingStory MCP

51
00:02:38,987 --> 00:02:41,856
server. Let's wait a moment again.

52
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:52,445
It is done.

53
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:55,393
Let's run it.

54
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,377
Even from an image, it created the page

55
00:03:06,377 --> 00:03:08,937
as instructed using the Demo UI library.

56
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:16,503
The stepper component is used correctly

57
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:17,743
and works as expected.

58
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:23,227
Let's review the generated source code

59
00:03:23,227 --> 00:03:23,707
again.

60
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:26,489
You can see that the components were

61
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,769
chosen and set up properly, based on the

62
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:30,969
information from the BlazingStory MCP

63
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:31,529
server.

64
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:35,248
As you can see, by using the new MCP

65
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,488
server feature of BlazingStory, we can

66
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:39,808
generate code that uses the specified UI

67
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:41,808
component library very accurately.

68
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,657
Thank you for watching!
